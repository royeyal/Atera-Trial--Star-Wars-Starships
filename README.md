# Atera Trial: Star Wars Starships

This a WordPress plugin that adds a **block** to the WordPress blocks editor that pulls data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

---

The code was written for a home assignment for [Atera](https://www.atera.com/) (hence, it was writen quick and dirty, but it gets the job done).
